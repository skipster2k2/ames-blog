      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never really seen the appeal of tandems, the poor old stoker sat at the back not able to see anything other than the pilot&amp;rsquo;s back, that was until we got a Hase Pino, quite possibly the strangest looking but most well-designed tandem there is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Pino is a semi-recumbent tandem, the stoker sits at the front on a recumbent seat, whilst the pilot is just behind in a standard bike configuration, the beauty of this design is that you share the same view, and your heads are close together, its easy to have a conversation even at speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a year since building my office shed so I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting round to writing this post about #shedlife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last May I joined Surevine, a remote software company. It was my first remote role, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any spare space in the house so I needed somewhere to be able to work. Because of the nature of our clients it needed to be somewhere where I could have conversations without being overheard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m slightly overwhelmed by how well &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/hidden-plymouth-route1-stoke-to-mutton-cove&#34;&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; has been received I have had some lovely feedback and suggestions for future routes. One such suggestion is to do something shorter that children can take part in, so where better than around Millbay. I can test it with my own kids as they go to Plymouth School of Creative Arts which is the starting point for this route.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=16cgN0xxCOX9BJIeOksILtykuBDKNyCk_&amp;hl=en&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are loads of quirky little features in and around Millbay, its relatively flat and the route is only 2km. If the walk doesn’t wear the little ones out, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parksnatureandgreenspaces/findpark/westhoepark&#34;&gt;West Hoe park&lt;/a&gt; is within walking distance too. The route starts outside the school and if you are driving there are three car parks nearby, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.3689901,-4.1520366,3a,75y,115.98h,93.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stpjtGYcS0qblHYZvv3xgww!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&#34;&gt;Martin Street&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/findsomewherepark/pavilionscarpark&#34;&gt;Pavilions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myringgo.co.uk/parkinglocator/2320&#34;&gt;Brunel Way&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately they are all Pay and Display.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hidden Plymouth, Route 1 - Stoke to Mutton Cove</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This route starts at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Stoke&amp;#43;Car&amp;#43;Park/@50.3805872,-4.1651648,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x880e5bffe7b91f5d!8m2!3d50.3805872!4d-4.1651648&#34;&gt;Stoke Village Car Park&lt;/a&gt;, which is free to park. It then climbs to what was once the highest point in Plymouth, before descending to sea level and back again.&#xA;I have mapped the route on Strava so you can download it to a GPS, or print out the map.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/stoke-mutton-cove-route.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Route map&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/stoke-mutton-cove-route-profile.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Elevation Profile&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have also run the route so you can see a fly through below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
