      <description>This post was originally published on the surevine blog.
3 months ago, I took the next step in my career and joined Surevine as a Team Lead. There were many things that first attracted me to the company, but one major benefit was that it’s totally remote, and so learning how to work collaboratively whilst remote was a challenge that really interested me.
Sureviner’s are spread all over the country, and my team alone covers a geographical area that stretches from Durham to Plymouth.</description>
