      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a year since building my office shed so I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting round to writing this post about #shedlife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last May I joined Surevine, a remote software company. It was my first remote role, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any spare space in the house so I needed somewhere to be able to work. Because of the nature of our clients it needed to be somewhere where I could have conversations without being overheard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
