      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the team got together to workshop how we move into the next phase of our project. Up until now we have mainly been in Discovery/Alpha mode, exploring the problem space and sketching out potential solutions.

There’s a long standing tradition in digital gov teams to have a mission patch at the end of a phase, its a nice way to build a team identity and celebrate success, given we had just finished alpha we were all keen to get a sticker created. This is what we did…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
