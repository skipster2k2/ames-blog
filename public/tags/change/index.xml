      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilemanifesto.org/&#34;&gt;agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, one of the things that most drew me to it was &amp;ldquo;Responding to change over following a plan&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on enough projects to see the benefit in changing direction when it&amp;rsquo;s clear that your plan isn&amp;rsquo;t going to help you hit your goal, and the sheer grinding death-march experience for teams when that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However the manifesto doesn&amp;rsquo;t say much about different types of change and how best to respond to them. I have 3 mental models of change that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in teams. I thought I would share as this is fairly early thinking (for me). I&amp;rsquo;m interested if others have seen these patterns, and what other models I&amp;rsquo;ve missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
