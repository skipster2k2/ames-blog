      <title>Product Prioritisation is triage</title>

      <description>Triage is used in medicine when acute care cannot be provided for lack of resources. The process rations care towards those who are most in need of immediate care, and who benefit most from it. More generally it refers to prioritisation of medical care as a whole. I have some personal experience of using triage from my time as a mountain rescue volunteer.
We would often train for scenarios where the number of casualties was more than our capacity to treat them all.</description>

      <description>Emily Webber recently asked if I could run an 8-minute workshop to energise people at the beginning of her regular Agile in the Ether remote meetup. (It is a very friendly meetup and well worth checking out).
This is the detail of the game I facilitated:
Objective Tell a story that develops iteratively and everyone in the group contributes to.
Instruction Each person adds a sentence to a story, but has to repeat the preceding sentences first, then nominates the next person to go.</description>

      <title>Essential Steps for an Effective Project Kick Off</title>
      <link>https://ames.world/blog/essential-steps-for-an-effective-project-kick-off/</link>

      <description>Kick-off’s are a great way of bringing a new team together at the start of a new project or phase of a project. The aim is to allow the team to get to know one another and to allow all the team members to understand the goals and objectives.
I recently helped facilitate a kick-off for the alpha phase of the ‘Protect’ service (working title). Although Protect had been through a discovery phase, circumstances meant that the Alpha team was quite different to the Discovery team.</description>

      <title>Mountaineering and a Rant About Risk Management</title>

      <description>I love hill climbing and mountaineering, ever since I was dragged up Pen-Y-Fan and got mild hypothermia in the scouts at about the age of 13. One of the best things yomping up hills has taught me is the nature of risk. So I was a bit surprised when I saw this tweet from Vasco Duarte:
Friends, let&amp;#39;s collect a list of domains where Risk ELIMINATION is priority #1: Climbing; Air travel industry; what else?</description>

      <title>Improving &#39;Find&#39; for the Find Property Information Service</title>
      <link>https://ames.world/blog/improving-find-for-the-find-property-information-service/</link>

      <description>Find Property Information is a GOV.UK service being developed by HM Land Registry which aims to provide a simple summary of property information. Recently we have improved our ‘postcode search’ functionality.
Why did we do this? Our first iteration of searching was developed over a year ago, we knew the limitations of it, but it was ‘good enough’ for the early stages of the service. This allowed us to move onto developing other features.</description>

      <title>How Our Digital Team Works</title>

      <description>I’m the Delivery Team Lead for a small multi-disciplinary team in government. We are developing the service in an agile way following the digital service standards developed by our colleagues at the Government Digital Service (GDS).
We recently added the ability to keep a copy of the title summary (basic information about a property). It’s a great example of what this way of working looks like in practice. Because we can continually develop the service, we aim to deliver the features that deliver most value quickly, rather than waiting for the whole service to be finished.</description>

      <title>5 Reasons Open Plan Offices Suck for Agile Teams</title>
      <link>https://ames.world/blog/5-reasons-open-plan-offices-suck-for-agile-teams/</link>

      <guid>https://ames.world/blog/5-reasons-open-plan-offices-suck-for-agile-teams/</guid>
      <description>I recently gave a presentation at the inaugural Tech Exeter conference called Practical agile: Lessons learned the hard way on our journey delivering digital products. In that presentation I claimed open plan offices are terrible team spaces, but didn&amp;rsquo;t really elaborate on why. Since then Neil Parker asked on twitter to explain why I thought open plan offices are bad team environments. So here is my totally unscientific personal listicle to explain why!</description>

      <description>I’m the scrum master for a small team developing a new service for a government agency. The team has been working in an agile way for 21 months. I have been with them for 16 of those months.
Over the last few months I have been feeling more and more anxious about the sustainability of sprints as we enter a new phase for our service.
We use Scrum as our methodology for delivering software.</description>

      <title>User Research Is the Most Frustrating Thing Ever</title>

      <description>I’m the scrum master for a small team developing a new service for a government agency. The team has been working in an agile way for 20 months. I have been with them for 15 of those months.
Our team is made up of user researchers, a designer, a BA, developers and testers.
Dealing with users isn’t new to me, before joining my current team I worked in IT operations and service management, dealing with angry and frustrated users was a day to day part of the role.</description>

      <title>The evolving visualisation of workflow in our team.</title>

      <description>I’m the scrum master for a small team developing a new service for a government agency. The team has been working in an agile way for 17 months. I have been with them for 12 of those months.
One of the main parts of my role is to help the team visualise the flow of work from idea to delivered. If we can see where work is (and how long it is there), we can see where it is getting blocked and I can go to work with my big unblocking hammer.</description>
