      <description>Emily Webber recently asked if I could run an 8-minute workshop to energise people at the beginning of her regular Agile in the Ether remote meetup. (It is a very friendly meetup and well worth checking out).

Objective Tell a story that develops iteratively and everyone in the group contributes to.
Instruction Each person adds a sentence to a story, but has to repeat the preceding sentences first, then nominates the next person to go.</description>
