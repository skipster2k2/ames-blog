      <description>I’m the scrum master for a small team developing a new service for a government agency. The team has been working in an agile way for 21 months. I have been with them for 16 of those months.
Over the last few months I have been feeling more and more anxious about the sustainability of sprints as we enter a new phase for our service.
We use Scrum as our methodology for delivering software.</description>

      <description>I’m the scrum master for a small team developing a new service for a government agency. The team has been working in an agile way for 17 months. I have been with them for 12 of those months.
One of the main parts of my role is to help the team visualise the flow of work from idea to delivered. If we can see where work is (and how long it is there), we can see where it is getting blocked and I can go to work with my big unblocking hammer.</description>
