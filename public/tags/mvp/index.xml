      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/shedlife_mug.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A mug of tea in my #shedlife mug&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A key part of agile delivery is working out what small changes can deliver the most value. It can be hard to get agreement on what is small enough to be valuable, getting this balance right is extremely difficult and context specific, hence why MVP’s (minimum viable products) are much maligned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two main approaches that can be used, you can either ‘slice thin’ deliver a small part of every step of the user journey; or ‘slice deep’ focus your effort on improving one part of the end to end service journey. Deciding which way to go depends on context, below are some things I try and consider with teams and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
