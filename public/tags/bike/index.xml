      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never really seen the appeal of tandems, the poor old stoker sat at the back not able to see anything other than the pilot&amp;rsquo;s back, that was until we got a Hase Pino, quite possibly the strangest looking but most well-designed tandem there is.
The Pino is a semi-recumbent tandem, the stoker sits at the front on a recumbent seat, whilst the pilot is just behind in a standard bike configuration, the beauty of this design is that you share the same view, and your heads are close together, its easy to have a conversation even at speed.</description>
