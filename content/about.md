## Profile
I am professional, enthusiastic and highly motivated with 19 years experience in IT and Digital service development and operation.

I have delivered projects to a range of Government organisations including the Cabinet Office, NATO, Dept for
Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) and TechUK. At Land Registry I delivered their first user-centred Digital services meeting the GDS Service Standard, as well as internal projects for 4000 distributed staff.

I have experience of a number of agile ways of working such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean Startup and DevOps. I am a certified Scrum Master.

I coach and lead multi-disciplinary teams of designers, developers, user-researchers and
business analysts. I encourage new ideas and new thinking to learn quickly and continuously to improve delivery and ensure our projects meet user needs.

I am a mainstay of Plymouth's digital community. I have organised and spoken at Agile Southwest
meetups, and have presented at the FutureSync. TechExeter, and Agile on the Beach conferences. I have also helped facilitate the excellent Agile in the Ether meetups and conference.
