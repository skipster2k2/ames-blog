Hello happy new year! I'm falling out of the habit of weeknoting again! To be honest I'm not sure unordered notes are working for me. For me weeknotes are as much about turning my swirly thoughts into coherent thinking, keeping them swirly doesn't help me. Anyway work will be changing very soon, hopefully I'll be able to be able to talk about it a bit more clearly.

# What's on my mind this week.

## Ending things
Getting the right level of detail and context down to help others pick up the baton, knowing no amount of words will be enough to cover all that tacit knowledge. My second favourite thing from Dave Snowden (after cynefin) is the [7 principles of knowledge management](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Principles_for_managing_knowledge), trying to hold them close this week.

Can we get on and make the 'download the knowledge into your brain' machine please!

This week is the last week [Andrew Duckworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anduckworth/) and I will be working together after nearly 18 months (on multiple projects) it's rare in contracting land to get to work with the same people for that long, and it's been an absolute pleasure. I'll miss working with you and I hope the next things make the most of your profound skills and talent.

## Starting things
Exciting, audacious goal, many questions, much to shape. Trying to be comfortable with knowing the least. Teams can only go as fast as the person with the least context. In perhaps a peak Devon analogy, I'm currently feeling like the tractor. I won't be alone feeling like that, need to make space to ask clarifying questions.

## Balance
Been having conversations about maintaining balance between work and home-life. Last year was intense swings from one to the other. Need to smooth out the waves this year, or at least surf them better.
