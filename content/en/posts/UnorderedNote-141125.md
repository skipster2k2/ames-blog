Continuing the effort of chucking down end of the week thoughts, as an attempt to keep up the weeknote habit, without talking about specifics of the day job. Week 2, go me!

# Things on my mind at the end of this week:

## Future of delivery management
Heard this week that the BBC are getting rid of their entire delivery management function, which pissed me right off. But after a few days of feeling angry, I became more reflective:
-  is delivery management viewed as value-less in other orgs, or is it evolving
- are we actually getting to the stage where the long held ambition of scrum masters, self organising teams, actually starting to happen (I see very little evidence thats true in the large orgs I work with)? 

These are questions worth pursuing and understanding in the longer term, for now its about helping people who's jobs are on the line. Public sector hero [Matt Jukes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jukesie/) has offered to do a DM special of his [Internet of Public Service Jobs newsletter](https://newsletter.digitalbydefault.jobs/) this week, so if your affected, make sure to subscribe and take a look. I'm also up for a chat, if its helpful, give me a shout #HugOps

## Communicating complexity
Been wrestling with the age old challenge of communicating complex problems to a fresh audience this week. Wondering is this complex, because we're not doing enough hard work to make it simple? There's only so much you can do on your own, before you need to start talking to others, to expand your understanding to make things simpler. This takes time and trust and is hard to do in an environment that needs answers right now.

Talking of trust, submitted my talk idea to the [Agile in the Ether](https://agileintheether.co.uk/) in real life meetup. It's based on [Jimmy Wales new book on trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Rules_of_Trust). I better get on a read it!

## Blog maintenance club
A few of us try to get together on Fridays to blog together. Today we realised we all had things we wanted to do to maintain our blogs (I say wanted to, the overarching feeling was, I dont want to think about maintenance!) so we got together and did a bunch of maintenance together. Moved this blog from netlify to github pages. Broke the css, this [post](https://namanattri.dev/posts/issue-with-css-not-loading-hugo-website-github-pages/) fixed it. Hooray for the internet, its easy to get disheartened about the state of the web, things like this remind me why I love it.

## Coworking
I've been coworking whilst we build a bathroom extension on the back of the house. I'm enjoying being around other people, being warm, and walking to 'work' the coworking space is in Devonport a square mile loaded with history, its making me want to go back to a [side project](https://skipster2k2.github.io/history-map/prototype/), lots to add to it, major learning to needed to make it api driven.

That'll do, pizza beckons.
