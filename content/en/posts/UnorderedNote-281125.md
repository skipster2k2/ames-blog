I'm trying to get back in the habit of weeknoting, but I can't be too specific about the work, so this is the random thoughts I'm dwelling on this week:

## Progress.
Palpable progress this week, it feels good! Not only that but being able to see a semblence of structure emerging.

## Pitching
Selling your wares is a constant thing where I am at the moment, honing those 'sales' skills of picking valuable leads, assessing whats a goer or not quickly is a real art.

## Reacting
Balancing being adaptive to clients very tight availability with team health.

## Visualising
Doing the hard work to make things simple. It's hard work innit!

## Concentrating
Taking notes, listening to whats being said, observing whats _not_ being said, contributing, finding space for others to contribute.

## Christmassing
Or not! Oh crap it's December next week!
