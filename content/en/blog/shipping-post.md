It's 20 years since I graduated from Uni this year and I've been thinking about writing a post about things I learnt that still stick with me, but I've been struggling to find the context to frame it.

Then a ship got stuck in the Suez canal!

Despite 20 years of working in IT and Digital, I left Uni with a degree in how to drive really big boats, I studied Marine Navigation, and despite my education background, and my career choice being chalk and cheese, I think having a slightly different worldview to most techies has served me well.

## It's easier to change course than speed.

Our lecturer told us once that if you were to scale down a modern container vessel to the size of a 30foot yacht, its engine would be the equivalent power of a hand held drill, and it's rudder would be the size of a postcard. These behemoths are seriously unwieldy.

Piloting a ship isn't like driving a car, there are generally three forces affecting velocity, the ship's engine, tides and wind (when your vessel is 57 m high and 400m long, that's a really large sail!). Working out which direction to go requires factoring in all these forces, often you will find yourself pointing in a different direction than where you want to go, in order to factor in these forces.

What' more when approaching land, or piloting through canals, water pressure becomes a problem. In the case of Ever Given, it displaces 200,000 tons, a ton is a cubic metre, so ever given is moving 200,000 cubic metres of water out of the way when she moves.  That water needs to go somewhere, and if you are in a narrow channel like a canal, there isnt really anywhere for it to go, so water pressure builds, requiring more power to move forward.

On top of this inertia is a real problem for vessels. The only way to brake a boat is to reverse engines, this can take literally miles to have a braking affect. 

You may think well ok I'll be cautious I'll go slow. Trouble is, if you drop below a certain speed, your rudder becomes ineffective, you lose 'steering way'.

Changing course by comparison is relatively easy, yes it can still take long distances, but is nowhere near the same expenditure in energy.

This is also true in software teams, building momentum takes time, making teams has inertia, people need to understand how to work together, they need to develop context for the problem(s) they are trying to solve. Once a team has built up a good amount of headway they can really work well, but if at the end of a project you split up a team, that momentum is lost. It's far more effective to change course than speed, give the team a different context, a new problem to solve. Sure they'll lose some velocity as they adjust to the new route, but they'll still have the momentum they've established for working together and will soon build up a head of steam.

**Pareto principle**

Roughly 80% of a passage plan will be uneventful, you'll be out in deep ocean, with lots of sea room and not much to crash into. The 20% where you are making landfall however, presents 80% of the challenges. Traffic increases, tides get stronger as they hit land. Land is problematic for boats! You may be constrained by your draft, or your ability to manoeuvre. The first and last parts of the journey tae the most amount of effort.

This is true-ish in software projects, putting in a good level of effort in establishing what the problem is 

Risk management.
