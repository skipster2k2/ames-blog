## User Manual of Ian Ames

I've used [Cassie Robinson's](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson) [User Manual of me](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) template a number of times when starting projects with new teams, its a great way to quickly introduce a team to how everyone likes to work and to discuss how best to work together. It also works well in remote organisations as a way to quickly learn about colleagues you may not see on a day to day basis. 

This is my user manual:

## Conditions I like to work in.

- Light, airy spaces
- With people to bounce ideas off of
- With tools that allow me to collaborate easily and shape ideas

## The times/hours I like to work

I'm not an early bird, and I usually have the school run to contend with so I'm not in much before 09:00. I dont mind short lunches and working late or in the evening to make up the difference.

I try not to work weekends.

## The best way to communicate with me 

Openly as possible!

- Chat/IM
- Face to face/ Video
- Phone/ Voice
- Carrier Pigeon
- Rock carving
- E-mail :)

## The ways I like to receive feedback

- Face to face.
- Honestly, but with suggestions on how I can improve.
- Give me the opportunity to come back and chat a few days later, feedback can take time to process.

## Things I need

- Enthusiasm
- Open mindedness
- The opportunity to understand why
- If I know what I need to do, space to get on with it (work from home is ideal)
- If there is uncertainty or I'm starting something new, collaboration is best (office is ideal).
- Space to think.
- Coffee!

## Things I struggle with

- Acronyms
- Ego
- Double meaning, I struggle with nuance
- I tend to think tangentally so can take conversations ideas in different directions sometimes, call me out if I'm drifting
- "We've always done it that way" and unnecessary process, if I dont understand why I'm doing something, or can't see any value in it, I probably won't do it
- If I'm not learning I get bored

## Things I love

- Unknowness, I love operating in the space of ideas and opportunities,the art of the possible, and turning them into reality
- Building great teams, I love the palpable buzz you get from a high performing team
- Flow, understanding how things get done, and making it better
- Having fun, I prefer an environment of openness and creativity


## Other things to know about me
