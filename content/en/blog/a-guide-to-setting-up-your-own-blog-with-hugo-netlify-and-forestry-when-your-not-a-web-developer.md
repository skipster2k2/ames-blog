I've been blogging for a while on Medium, and whilst the writing experience was great, I have been frustrated with the funding model on the platform for a while. I have no interest in making money from my content (it probably isn't good enough to deserve it!) and Medium is no longer optimised for just sharing knowledge. So for a while I have wanted to move away, but where to?

The obvious choice for most people is a hosted Wordpress site, however I didn't want to spend any money on hosting if I could avoid it, at the same time I didnt want to spend ages hosting my own WordPress instance and worrying about upgrades. I also didn't want to spend ages learning php, I'm not a web developer. So what to do?

Last year my team worked on a small project to rebuild the Department for Culture Media and Sports' [cyber exchange website](https://cyberexchange.uk.net/).
