#Ian Ames. 

I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way.

***

# Profile					
I have over 20 years experience delivering projects to a range of Government organisations including the Ministry of Justice, Cabinet Office, DEFRA, Dept for Culture Media and Sport, NHS Digital and TechUK.

I have experience of a number of agile practices such as Scrum, Kanban, Cynefin, Lean and DevOps. In recent years I have tended to specialise in the early phases of a service lifecycle. I enjoy working in small teams; being at the intersection of product, tech, and UX; and taking the seed of an idea and shaping it to achievable outcomes.

I have experience of leading co-located, distributed and fully remote teams. Clear communication and a shared understanding of goals is key, regardless of where your team is. I work hard to ensure teams are pulling in the same direction and are focused on the project outcomes.

I have spoken at meetups for Agile Southwest, Product Makers, Citizens Advice and Co-Op digital communities, and have presented at a number of conferences including [Agile on the Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFFoI9lI-zY&ab_channel=AgileontheBeach). I was one of the founding members of [DeliverCon](https://medium.com/@IanAmes/delivercon-what-to-expect-on-the-day-65433460ecf1), an unconference for delivery managers in the public sector, I have also helped facilitate the excellent Agile in the Ether and Product in the (A)ether meetups and conferences.


# Projects		 	 	 		
## Benchmark system for flood hydrology discovery. 2023 - present
A discovery that had a very firm idea of the solution before understanding the problems to be solved. It required me to advocate for user centred practices and to frame discovery as due-diligence, providing assurance that a benchmark system is what is needed. Through a combination of research, service mapping and coaching; I was able to reframe the objectives to 3 much clearer problems to explore. Whilst a bespoke digital solution feels unfeasible on cost grounds, there are problems to be solved and an opportunity to test the service standard and ucd practices in a more relational setting. 


## Refer and Monitor accredited programmes. 2022 - 2023
Leading a multidisciplinary team through discovery to beta exploring how to improve referrals and data driven decision making to accredited programmes, behavioural programmes offered to prisoners in custody and on probation designed to address behavioural needs to help with reintegration into society.

I helped the team archive a ‘met’ in the alpha assessment for the first time, using my experience of previous assessments to guide the team to success. I have navigated internal MOJ processes to understand how to get things done, which processes are absolute ‘must haves’ to be done, and what can be challenged to help us move at pace.

I have been responsible for communicating to a large stakeholder group about project progress and supporting the product manager to ensure we’re clear about what our priorities are, what will get delivered, and importantly, what won’t get delivered immediately and why.

## Patient Encounter History - 2021-22
Led the development of a product to enable clinicians from different parts of Urgent and Emergency Care to view information about patient encounters in other care settings in order to help diagnose complex cases, reassure patients, build rapport, and to identify worsening conditions. This was developed in a user centred way using Discovery to understand patient and clinical needs and Alpha to iteratively prototype and explore technical options.

## GPintheCloud, 2020 - 21
Led the development of a product to enable GP Locums to access clinical systems for multiple surgeries from one device securely. The service was developed based on user feedback and enabled Locums to support GP surgeries from anywhere in the country, crucial during the coronavirus pandemic, but a solution to the challenge of GP distribution across the country.

## Cyber Exchange, 2020
Project Lead for the delivery of Cyber-Exchange, a platform for UK Cyber Security businesses to connect, find funding opportunities and events. Sponsored by DCMS and Tech UK.
Future Vetting Service, 2019
Project lead for the delivery of serverless future vetting website on AWS, with cross domain aspects on Docker Swarm, working closely with the NCSC and the Cabinet Office, leading a multi-disciplinary team of User Researchers , Designers , Developers , and Testers and supporting and coaching the teams Product Managers in Agile ways of working.

## Protect Alpha, 2018
A citizen focused service to allow citizens to easily protect their property interests. Keep their information on the register up to date, and to raise awareness of what the Land Registry is and how we protect most people’s largest asset, their home.
Find Property Information, 2016 - 17
A citizen focused service aimed at presenting basic land information for a number of user needs. Built on an entirely new infrastructure stack, including accounts, payment, audit, and address API’s. Migrated 24 million titles of land ownership data to a new database platform. Developed our emerging agile practices and increased our deployment frequency from once a month to on-demand, completing 76 production deploys in 2017.
