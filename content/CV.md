# Ian Ames. 

I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way.

# Profile					
I have over 20 years experience delivering projects to a range of Government organisations and companies, including the Ministry of Justice, Cabinet Office, DEFRA, Dept for Culture Media and Sport, NHS Digital and BT.

I have experience of a number of agile practices such as Scrum, Kanban, Cynefin, Lean and DevOps. In recent years I have tended to specialise in the early phases of a service lifecycle. I enjoy working in small teams; being at the intersection of product, tech, and UX; and taking the seed of an idea and shaping it to achievable outcomes.

I have experience of leading co-located, distributed and fully remote teams. Clear communication and a shared understanding of goals is key, regardless of where your team is. I work hard to ensure teams are pulling in the same direction and are focused on the project outcomes.

I have spoken at meetups for Agile Southwest, Product Makers, Citizens Advice and Co-Op digital communities, and have presented at a number of conferences including Service Design in Government and Agile on the Beach. I was one of the founding members of DeliverCon, an unconference for delivery managers in the public sector, I have also helped facilitate the excellent Agile in the Ether and Product in the (A)ether meetups and conference.

### Project: Building Products Together

Supporting BT implementing a new Product Operating Model aimed at bringing digital and business people closer together aligned around products and services. A large complex transformation involving multiple stakeholders and delivery partners.

My role is frontrunner lead, supporting and coaching the first tribe established in this model. I lead a team defining, testing, and documenting ways of working. I created and taught a series of masterclasses focused on modern product management and delivery practices, focused on the mindset changes needed to make the transformation a success.

Mapping service journeys based on user research.

Through a combination of research, service mapping and coaching; I was able to reframe the objectives to 3 much clearer opportunities to explore in alpha.

I helped the team archive a ‘met’ in the alpha assessment for the first time, using my experience of previous assessments to guide the team to success. I have navigated internal MOJ processes to understand how to get things done, which processes are absolute ‘must haves’ to be done, and what can be challenged to help us move at pace.

I worked with stakeholders and commissioners to understand strategy intent and goals. Understanding user needs to ensure our product meets them. Setting team priorities and ensuring value is delivered. Being the ‘voice of the product’ to the wider organisation.The main focus was on how to improve the quality of emergency dental referral information in the DoS.

### Project: Patient Encounter History

Led the development of a product to enable clinicians from different parts of Urgent and Emergency Care to view information about patient encounters in other care settings in order to help diagnose complex cases, reassure patients, build rapport, and to identify worsening conditions. This was developed in a user centred way using Discovery to understand patient and clinical needs and Alpha to iteratively prototype and explore technical options.

The service was developed based on user feedback and enabled Locums to support GP surgeries from anywhere in the country, crucial during the coronavirus pandemic, but a solution to the challenge of GP distribution across the country.
