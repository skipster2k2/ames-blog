## Profile


**I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way.**

I have over 20 years experience delivering projects to a range of Government organisations including the Ministry of Justice, Cabinet Office, DEFRA, Dept for Culture Media and Sport, NHS Digital and TechUK.

I have experience of a number of agile practices such as Scrum, Kanban, Cynefin, Lean and DevOps. In recent years I have tended to specialise in discoveries, I enjoy taking nebulous ideas, or solution focused objectives and shaping them to outcomes based on user needs to get at what is really required and achievable.
I have experience of leading co-located, distributed and fully remote teams. Clear communication and a shared understanding of goals is key, regardless of where your team is. I work hard to ensure teams are pulling in the same direction and are focused on the project outcomes.

I have spoken at meetups for Agile Southwest, Product Makers, Citizens Advice and Co-Op digital communities, and have presented at the FutureSync, [TechExeter](https://www.slideshare.net/techexeter/practical-agile-lessons-learned-the-hard-way-on-our-journey-building-digital-products), and [Agile on the Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFFoI9lI-zY) conferences. I have also helped facilitate the excellent [Agile in the Ether](https://agileintheether.co.uk/) and [Product in the (A)ether](https://www.pita.social/) meetups and conference.

## Projects

### Benchmark system for flood hydrology discovery.

A discovery that had a very firm idea of the solution before understanding the problems to be solved. This required me to advocate for user centred practices and to frame discovery as due-diligence, providing assurance that a benchmark system is what is needed. Through a combination of research and service mapping and lots of conversations and coaching, I was able to reframe the objectives to 3 much clearer problems to explore. Whilst a digital solution feels unfeasible on cost grounds, there are problems to be solved and an opportunity to test the service standard and ucd practices in a more relational setting than most transactional services. The reccomendations for alpha have been well received and ther ehas been lots of praise and appreciation for the conclusions we reached and the direction we have set.

### Refer and Monitor and accredited Programme - 2023

Worked with stakeholders to provide a vision of how the tem could deliver relevant information regardles of dta source, reducing the need for data duplication, balanced against stringent performance requirmeents for data in urgent care settings.

Led the development of a product to enable clincians from different parts of Urgent and Emergency Care to view information about patient encounters in other care settings in order to help diagnose complex cases, reassure patients and build rapport, and to identify worsening conditions. This was developed in a user centred way using Discovery to understand patient and clincial needs and Alpha to iteratively prototype and explore technical options.

Led the development of a product to enable GP Locums to access clinical systems for multiple surgeries from one device securely.
