## Profile


**I help multidisciplinary teams deliver services in a user centred way.**

I have delivered projects to a range of Government organisations including the Cabinet Office, Dept for Culture Media and Sport, NHS Digital, Ministry of Justice and TechUK. 

At Land Registry I delivered their first user-centred Digital services meeting the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), as well as internal projects for 4000 distributed staff.

I have experience of a number of agile ways of working such as Scrum, Kanban, Cynefin, Lean and DevOps.

I have experience of leading co-located, distributed and fully remote teams. Clear communication and a shared understanding of goals is key, regardless
of where your team is. I work hard to ensure teams are pulling in the same direction and are focused on the project outcomes.

I have spoken at meetups for Agile Southwest, Product Makers, Citizens Advice and Co-Op digital communities, and have presented at the FutureSync, [TechExeter](https://www.slideshare.net/techexeter/practical-agile-lessons-learned-the-hard-way-on-our-journey-building-digital-products), and [Agile on the Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFFoI9lI-zY) conferences. I have also helped facilitate the excellent [Agile in the Ether](https://agileintheether.co.uk/)
 and [Product in the (A)ether](https://www.pita.social/) meetups and conference.
