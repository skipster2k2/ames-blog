I've never really seen the appeal of tandems, the poor old stoker sat at the back not able to see anything other than the pilot's back, that was until we got a Hase Pino, quite possibly the strangest looking but most well designed tandem there is.

The Pino is a semi-recumbent tandem, the stoker sits at the front on a recumbent seat, whilst the pilot is just behind in a standard bike configuration, the beauty of this design is that you share the same view, and your heads are close together, its easy to have a conversation even at speed on the Pino.

We got our Pino second-hand this year for my daughter and I to ride, there are lots of great reviews of the Pino already, especially for cycle tourers but I haven't seen any aimed at addressing questions for families or disabled cyclists for which the Pino is ideally suited.

## The cost.

The biggest challenge of the Pino was the cost, [a new Pino]() has a comparable cost to a small family car. At todays prices the non-electric motor version will set you back around 5000 pounds for the base model, and the accessories aren't cheap either. Initially we started looking at the [Circe Morpheus](https://www.circecycles.com/products/morpheus/) instead, an equivalent bike for around 3000 pounds, however again this was for the base model and accessories soon started to ramp the price up beyond my budget.

So we turned to the second hand market without much hope, these bikes are pretty niche and I didn't expect there to be much of a second hand market. I setup eBay alerts for the both the Pino and the Morpheus. I haven't had a single alert for the Morpheus, but Pino's appeared at a fairly steady rhythm during the summer of 2020, maybe the lockdown convinced owners they didn't need them anymore?

What was clear from the second hand market was that the bikes kept their value, I saw a 20 year old Pino go for 2500 pounds, I didn't feel confident this was going to be any better for my wallet. The big advantage however was that nearly all the second hand bikes had already been accessorised with the things I considered to have to have to be viable, especially the kickstand, which was an additional 200 pound accessory. Many came with other extras that would be beneficial such as the front lowrider pannier rack, or kids cranks for the front seat.

After bidding unsuccessfully on a few, I finally got lucky with winning a bid on a 2 year old Pino with stand and seatbelt for the recumbent seat. I couldn't believe I won it went for much the same price as the 20 year old Pino mentioned earlier, I was very happy to get such a new bike in such good condition, the only problem was it was in Harrogate and I lived in Plymouth!
