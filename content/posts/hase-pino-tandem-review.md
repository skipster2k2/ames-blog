My eldest daughter has always loved cycling from an early age, when we used to go out regularly on my bike and her in an i-bert safe-t-seat mounted on the front bars. Unfortunately she has a degenerative condition which affects her balance (I won't go into detail that's her story to tell) and over the last few years her confidence riding on her own has been really affected.
