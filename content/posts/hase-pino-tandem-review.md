I've never really seen the appeal of tandems, the poor old stoker sat at the back not able to see anything other than the pilot's back, that was until we got a Hase Pino, quite possibly the strangest looking but most well designed tandem there is.

The Pino is a semi-recumbent tandem, the stoker sits at the front on a recumbent seat, whilst the pilot is just behind in a standard bike configuration, the beauty of this design is that you share the same view, and your heads are close together, its easy to have a conversation even at speed on the Pino.

We got our Pino second-hand this year for my daughter and I to ride, there are lots of great reviews of the Pino already, especially for cycle tourers but I haven't seen any aimed at addressing questions for families or disabled cyclists for which the Pino is ideally suited.

## The cost.

The biggest challenge of the Pino was the cost, [a new Pino]() has a comparable cost to a small family car. At todays prices the non-electric motor version will set you back around 5000 pounds for the base model, and the accessories aren't cheap either. Initially we started looking at the [Circe Morpheus](https://www.circecycles.com/products/morpheus/) instead, an equivalent bike for around 3000 pounds, however again this was for the base model and accessories soon started to ramp the price up beyond my budget.

So we turned to the second hand market without much hope, these bikes are pretty niche and I didn't expect there to be much of a second hand market. I setup eBay alerts for the both the Pino and the Morpheus. I haven't had a single alert for the Morpheus, but Pino's appeared at a fairly steady rhythm during the summer of 2020, maybe the lockdown convinced owners they didn't need them anymore?

What was clear from the second hand market was that the bikes kept their value, I saw a 20 year old Pino go for 2500 pounds, I didn't feel confident this was going to be any better for my wallet. The big advantage however was that nearly all the second hand bikes had already been accessorised with the things I considered to have to have to be viable, especially the kickstand, which was an additional 200 pound accessory. Many came with other extras that would be beneficial such as the front lowrider pannier rack, or kids cranks for the front seat.

After bidding unsuccessfully on a few, I finally got lucky with winning a bid on a 2 year old Pino with stand and seatbelt for the recumbent seat. I couldn't believe I won it went for much the same price as the 20 year old Pino mentioned earlier, I was very happy to get such a new bike in such good condition, the only problem was it was in Harrogate and I lived in Plymouth!

## Transporting the Pino.

I had won the bike and needed to get 350 miles to Harrogate, it was the end of July 2020, Britain had just come out of lockdown, luckily that meant the roads were pretty quite!

I travelled up in our campervan so I could save money by parking overnight in a truck stop (and to be honest I was a little Covid paranoid about staying in a hotel or b&b). I planned to transport the Pino back on my rear mounted bike rack but I was worried about the width. The maximum vehicle width in the UK is 2.55 metres, and the Pino is 2.1 metres when the front boom is at its shortest. The van is only 1.9 metres wide, I was worried about the overhang on such a long journey.

I got to Harrogate and picked the bike up from a lovely family, the bike was immaculate, but I chickened out of loading on the rear rack and instead put down the rock-and-roll bed in the van and loaded the bike on top.

I have since summoned up the courage to transport the Pino on the rear rack, the furthest it has been is about 40 miles to Bodmin and it does overhang a lot, but taking it easy and with judicious width given on the left side on Cornish country lanes, we haven't had any issues so far.

It is possible to split the Pino in half to aid transport, I haven't done this yet, I'm not sure how much of a faff disconnecting the front chain and brakes would be.

## What's it like to ride?

I'd read in a few articles that it could take a bit of getting used to riding the Pino, the handlebars are quite wide apart, but I didn't find this the case at all, in fact I was amazed at how stable the Pino was, it always feels well grounded when both of use are on it. The only issue I found with the handlebars was that on long rides my shoulders ached from my arms being so wide, it is possible to change the angle of the handlebars, and bringing them in slightly improved this enormously and didn't affect stability.
