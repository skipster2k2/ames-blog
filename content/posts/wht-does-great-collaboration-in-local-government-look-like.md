I have a soft spot for local government, it's where most people's interaction with government happen, and yet it is also one of the most underfunded parts. Arguably constraint is the mother of invention and local government doesn't get enough credit for the work they do to to deliver services for citizens effectively and cheaply. So I asked twitter to share with me some examples of great collaboration in local gov, here's some great examples that were shared:

LocalGov Digital is a network of digital practitioners that emerged in 2012

## LocalGov drupal.

Councils on the whole offer much the same services, yet most councils build bespoke CMS's to fulfill these needs. [LocalGov drupal](https://twitter.com/LocalGovDrupal) is an attempt to cut down the duplication. It is an [open source project](https://github.com/localgovdrupal), and like all good open source projects it has emerged from collaboration between Brighton and Hove CC, Croydon CC and many others. The distribution is based on the best practice guidance from GDS (the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)). You can read more about how the project grew in this [post by Aleck](https://medium.com/miggle/localgov-drupal-finally-happened-80bf0d7f895b).
