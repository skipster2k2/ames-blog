I have a soft spot for local government, it's where most people's interaction with government happen, and yet it is also one of the most underfunded parts of government. Arguably constraint is the mother of invention and local government doesn't get enough credit for the work they do to work accross boundaries to deliver services fro citizens effectively and cheaply. So I asked twitter to share with me some examples, the results were fantastic!
